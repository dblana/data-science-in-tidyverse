This is the repo for *"Introduction to R and the tidyverse"* given at Aberdeen University in December 2019.

## Description

This is a one-day hands on workshop based on the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). You will learn how to visualize and transform data in R and work with date-times, character strings, and untidy data formats. Along the way, you will learn and use many packages from the tidyverse including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.

## Software Requirements

You'll be using RStudio Cloud, so (all going well) on the day of the workshop all you'll need is **a laptop that can access the internet**.  

In the unlikely event that there are problems with the internet connection, you may want to have a local installation on your computer as a backup. If you'd like, install the following (but we can also do this on the day):
 
1. A recent version of R (~3.6.1), which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](http://www.cran.r-project.org)
2. A recent version of RStudio IDE (~1.2.5019), available for free at [www.rstudio.com/download](http://www.rstudio.com/download)
3. The set of relevant R packages, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running:  
 
    install.packages(c("babynames", "fivethirtyeight", "formatR", "gapminder", "hexbin", "mgcv", "maps", "mapproj", "nycflights13", "rmarkdown", "skimr", "tidyverse", "viridis")) 

Don't forget to bring your power cord!
